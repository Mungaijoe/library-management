# DJANGO LOCAL LIBRARY
This web application creates an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

The main features that have currently been implemented are:
* Users can join the library membership.
* The Members can view all the books in the library and borrow them.
* The librarian can append books and track borrowed books.
